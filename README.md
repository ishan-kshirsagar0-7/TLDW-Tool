# TLDW - Too Long ; Didn't Watch

## Introduction

TLDW Tool is a web app that uses Generative AI to generate concise, to-the-point and relevant summary for any YouTube video. It takes the URL of the YouTube video as the input, and displays the content of the entire video in the format of bulleted points.

NOTE - The YouTube URL must be of the format `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video-id}`

Since the [TLDW API](https://tldw-tool.onrender.com) has been deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) as a Free Tier Web Service, the cold start might cause a delay in loading of the summary for the first use. Once the API becomes active, the summaries henceforth won't take as much long.
